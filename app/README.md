# Welcome to MealPlannerAI

This app was a fun idea I thought of when looking inside of my fridge.

"Wouldn't it be cool if I could take a picture of the inside of my fridge and
get a meal plan?"

I've never worked with ML/AI before and the thought immediately occurred to me
this would be a fun project to learn with!

## Specifications

- This is a react-native app, using typescript.
- The app will allow users to take pictures. These will be analyzed for ingredients.
- The app will give a user meal plan suggestions given ingredients and quantity of it.

## Design

The purpose of this app isn't to improve/showoff my UX/UI skills, instead I am
more interested in creating the AI/ML technology to accomplish the main goal.

To avoid being bogged down with design I will structure the UX off of the ChatGPT
mobile app. Additionally most components will be taken from an existing library (TBD).
